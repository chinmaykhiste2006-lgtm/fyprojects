## 📌 Introduction  
Cephalometric analysis is an essential step in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditionally, clinicians manually annotate anatomical landmarks on cephalograms — a process that is time-consuming and prone to variability.  

This project implements an **AI-powered Cephalometric Landmark Detection system** using a **ResNet18-based CNN** to automatically localize 19 key landmarks on cephalometric radiographs. Our approach reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and demonstrates how deep learning can assist in medical imaging tasks.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🖼️ **Automatic landmark detection** on cephalometric X-rays.  
- ⚡ **ResNet18 backbone** for robust feature extraction.  
- 🔄 **Data preprocessing & augmentation** (resizing, flipping, brightness).  
- 📊 **Scalable pipeline** for training and evaluation.  
- 🧪 Outputs **38 coordinates** (x, y for each of 19 landmarks).  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- Images: Cephalometric radiographs (original size: **2400 × 1935**).  
- Labels: CSV files containing 19 anatomical landmarks per image.  
- Preprocessing: Images resized to **512 × 512**, landmarks scaled accordingly.  

⚠️ Dataset is private/academic and not included here.  

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
- Backbone: **ResNet18 (pretrained on ImageNet)**, truncated before final layers.  
- Global Average Pooling: Reduces feature maps to (512, 1, 1).  
- Regression Head:  
  - Linear(512 → 256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)  
  - Linear(256 → 38) → Outputs (x, y) pairs for 19 landmarks.
