Ah! I understand — you want the README to **look visually sharp and organized on GitHub**, with proper headings, badges, and spacing so it renders nicely. Let me rewrite it in a **well-styled Markdown** version that will display clearly when uploaded:

## 📌 Project Overview
**Cephalometric Landmark Detection** is an automated system using **deep learning** to predict **19 anatomical landmarks** on lateral skull X-rays. This is useful in:

- Orthodontics
- Craniofacial surgery planning
- Diagnostic analysis

The system includes:

- PyTorch **training and evaluation pipelines**
- **Mean Euclidean Error (MEE)** computation (pixels & millimeters)
- Visualization of **predicted vs. ground truth landmarks**
- Interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions

---

## 🚀 Features

- **ResNet18 backbone** (pretrained on ImageNet) with custom regression head  
- **Custom PyTorch Dataset** with image resizing and augmentation  
- Data augmentation: **horizontal flip**, **brightness adjustment**  
- Training with **MSELoss** and validation with **MEE tracking**  
- Evaluation script saving **overlay images and metrics**  
- Streamlit app with **interactive visualization and CSV export**

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Public cephalometric dataset (400+ lateral skull X-rays)  
- **Annotations**: CSV files with image paths + 19 (x, y) landmark coordinates  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images resized to **512×512**
  - Landmarks scaled to match resized images
  - Optional augmentations applied during training

---

## 🏗 Model Architecture

- **Backbone**: ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet  
- **Regression Head**:

```

Flatten → Linear(512 → 256) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(256 → 38)

````

- **Output**: 38 values → 19 landmarks (x, y)

---

## ⚙️ Training

Run training:

```bash
python train.py
````

* **Loss**: MSELoss
* **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.001)
* **Batch Size**: 32
* **Epochs**: 50

Sample log:

```
Epoch 10/50 | Train Loss: 0.0021 | Val Loss: 0.0030 | MEE: 2.15 px / 0.57 mm
✅ Best model saved!
```

---

## 📈 Evaluation

Run evaluation:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

* Computes **per-image and average MEE**
* Saves **overlay images** in `output_images/`
* Stores final score in `mee_score.txt`

---

## 💻 Streamlit Web Application

Run the web app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Features:

* Upload X-ray → get predicted landmarks
* Toggle overlays:

  * Ground truth landmarks
  * Predicted landmarks
  * Error arrows
  * Landmark indices
* Plots:

  * Landmark overlay
  * Mean Euclidean Error (MEE)
  * Intensity histogram
  * Quadrant distribution
* Download predicted landmarks as **CSV**

---

## 📊 Results

* Achieved **Mean Euclidean Error (MEE)**:

```
X.XX px ≈ Y.YY mm
```

* Predicted landmarks closely match ground truth landmarks

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Heatmap-based landmark detection
* Transformer-based architectures for global context
* Semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data
* Larger datasets for better generalization

If you want, I can **also create a visually appealing “GitHub ready” badges + table for dataset, results, and dependencies** so your README looks **like a professional paper**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
