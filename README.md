# ​ First-Year Engineering Projects  

Welcome to my repository of **First-Year Engineering Projects**.  
This repository is a curated collection of my initial explorations into **software development, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems**.  

Each project demonstrates problem-solving, coding proficiency, and collaboration skills developed during my first year of engineering.
