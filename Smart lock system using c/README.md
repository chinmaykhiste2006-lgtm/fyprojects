# üîê Smart Lock System (C)

## üìå Description
A Windows console-based **Smart Lock** written in C. It supports multiple doors, each with its own password and optional hint. The program enforces a basic password policy (first letter capital, length ‚â• 8). On wrong attempts it triggers an audible alarm and flashes the console. After **5 failed attempts**, it shows a warning **popup** and runs a **10-second countdown**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compile & Run (Windows)

### Option 1: MinGW (GCC)
```bash
gcc lock.c -o lock.exe -luser32
.\lock.exe
```

### Option 2: Microsoft Visual C++ (Developer Command Prompt)
```bat
cl lock.c user32.lib
lock.exe
