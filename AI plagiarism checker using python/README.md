# 🤖 AI Text Detection & Plagiarism Checker  

## 📌 Description  
A Python-based project that predicts whether a text file is **AI-generated** or **human-written**, and also estimates **how much of it is AI-generated**. The project combines **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** techniques with similarity and classification methods to analyze text authenticity.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 📝 Detect if text is **AI-generated** or **human-written**.  
- 📊 Estimate the **percentage of AI-generated content** in a file.  
- 🔎 Compare files for plagiarism/similarity using **cosine similarity**.  
- 🖥️ Simple and user-friendly interface (via `app.py`).  
- ⚡ Fast text preprocessing and analysis.
